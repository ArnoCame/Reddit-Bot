            "definition": "The common practice of typing messages on a cell phone to recipients, rather than [just just] take the twelve seconds to call someone. Most often performed by teenage girls, these messages often include such [front page news] as: \"OMG did U C her @ss? [Itz] HGE\" or perhaps the ever-popular \"WTF? Dani just broke up wit James!!!11!\"\n\nThese messages are often life-changing, as it seems that nobody ever actually speaks to one another anymore.\n\nMy favorite example of the texting is when a teenage girl is driving, head bent down facing her cell phone, as she texts while in traffic. Young teenage girls are considered the best drivers, so surely something as simple as texting would never take away from their near-perfect driving skills. This is often proven by the practice of never using turn signals, as telling [Katelyn] about when to pick her up at the mall is WAY more important than letting the cars behind you know that you are about to cross three lanes of traffic.\n\nAll in all, perhaps a few head-on collisions and loss of driving [privileges] will be a good little lesson to the self-absorbed teenagers of today.",
